This project is a work in progress. I will be compiling a Scheller Segregation Model of voter parties do generate a dataset that shows the relationship between inter-party neighbor tolerance and community-wide inequality measures.
Through this project, I'm aiming to learn and apply STATA software for the first time, while honing my data cleaning and analysis skills in python.
